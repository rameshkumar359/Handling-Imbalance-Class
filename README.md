# Handling-Imbalance-Class
## In this project I have done predictions for Fraud credit card transcation along with handling Imbalanced class of the data
## Used some commonly used Methods like
### 1)Under-Sampling.
### 2)Over-Sampling.
### 3)SMOTE-(Synthetic Minority Over Sampling Technique).
### 4)Ensemble-Technique.
#### USED LOGISTIC REGRESSION FOR FRAUD DETECTION.
#### IN THIS PROJECT AS BOTH RECALL AND PRECCESION ARE IMPORTANT SO FOCUSING ON F-1 SCORE.
#### DIRECLY USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION WITH UNBALANCED CLASS
